        <p id="sectionDesc"> Tas & Repon met in 2016 when they were both working at The Apple Store.
          Even though mismatched schedules (Repon, ever the early bird, worked the morning shift, and Tas, in typical night-owl fashion, worked evenings) tried to keep them apart,
           Repon was smitten as soon as he saw Tas.
          Eventually a proactive coworker engineered a group outing at Disneyland so they could finally spend time together, and they saw fireworks – literally. And even though Tas tried to blow Repon off,
          he persevered and they finally went on their first real date.
          The rest is history. Shortly after they started dating,
         Tas moved to New York and Repon followed. On a sunny September day in 2018 he proposed in front of the Brooklyn Bridge. Tas said yes, and now they are planning their wedding.
          And you’re invited!
